Uuid
=============

Based on the same interface that UUID from Assaf Arkin:
http://github.com/assaf/uuid/tree/master

The main difference is that this class simply wraps the native java
methods when used in JRuby based applications.

This class creates a universally unique identifier (UUID), representing a 128-bit value. 


Example
=======

UUID.generate()


Code
====
git clone git://github.com/jdamick/uuid.git
- or install as a plugin -
./script/plugin install git://github.com/jdamick/uuid.git
